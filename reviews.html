  Reviews from My Past Tour Group Members
</h1>
<p>
  <i>Rachel was my tour guide at Hohenschönhausen, the former Stasi prison, in May 2017. A young American historian, native of California,<br> she was quick to point up her East European and Jewish ancestry, and several years residency in Berlin. All of which gave her a uniquely<br> distanced, yet very grounded and very knowledgeable perspective on the history of Hohenschönhausen. She took every opportunity to<br> engage with the group and answered all our questions with enthusiasm and intelligence. However, what I most appreciated about Rachel<br> was her levity throughout. Hohenschönhausen is somewhere that has been witness to the most unspeakable crimes. But the manner in<br> which Rachel conducted the tour ensured that it was never too emotionally wrought, and not at all the gruelling 2 hours it could have been.<br> In sum total, Rachel's a great tour guide. And a warm, passionate, smart individual.</i><br> <b> — Matthew Robinson, London </b>

  <i>Rachel led a fascinating tour of the Berlin Wall Memorial (Bernauerstrasse) for my high school group last summer and she was simply<br> amazing.  She is a proverbial wealth of knowledge and her passion and excitement for the material she presented was contagious.  She<br> has an unusual ability to enrapture her audiences with her tales of the past, bringing the time and events alive in a way that appeals to all<br> ages.  I highly recommend her as a tour guide and look forward to working with her again!</i><br> <b> — Dr. Susannah Martin, Senior Program Leader for Berlin, Council on International Educational Exchange</b>

  <i>Rachel is an experienced, knowledgeable, and personable guide. She guided my group of 20 university students at both<br> Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp and again at the Hohenschönhausen Prison Camp in Berlin. She has a unique ability to<br> contextualize and personalize Germany’s difficulty history. I would highly recommend her tours to anyone who wants a serious,<br> informative, and very interesting introduction to Germany’s past.</i>  <br> <b> — Dr. Charles Vannette, Assistant Professor of German, Berlin Program Director</b>

  <i>Unsere Gruppe war sehr begeistert von Rachels Führung an der Gedenkstätte Berliner Mauer. Sie hat sehr<br> anschaulich und lebhaft erzählt und informiert. Man konnte ihr gut Folgen und wurde zum Nachdenken angeregt.</i><br> <b> — Ulrike Krone, Deutsch-Amerikanisches Institut, Tübingen </b>
